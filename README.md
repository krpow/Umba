## SQL1.txt: Joining tables
For this question, I joined all three tables (users, loans, transactions) at once, then used a WHERE clause to make sure all the loan status of the loans were either active or repaid and the transaction type was a disbursement. I also ordered the created data in descending order. 

## SQL2.txt: Aggregation
For this question, when I grouped the data by the month created. When selecting columns, I used count() to find the number of loans per month, sum() to find the total amount of all loans in that month, avg() to find the average amoount of each loan per month, min() to find the smallest loan size per month, max() to find the largest loan size per month. Finally, I ordered the data by month in descending order.

## Python Challenge
For this question, people who received a free trial were usually the ones who logged in the most. Those who worked in technology, on the west coast or companies of size 100-500 million are also the groups that had the most weekly logins.
